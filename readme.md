# Orbital Simulation

This project simulates the motion of orbital objects around a central body (e.g., Earth) in 3D space. It visualizes the orbits of two objects and calculates their relative speed over time.

## Features

- **3D Visualization**: Displays the orbits of two objects in a 3D space using `matplotlib`.
- **Dynamic Simulation**: Updates the positions of the objects in real-time.
- **Relative Speed Calculation**: Computes and displays the relative speed between the two objects at regular intervals.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to input inclination and longitude values for the orbital objects.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lalith-Shravan/math-ia-simulation.git
   cd math-ia-simulation
